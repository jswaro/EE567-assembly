%
% \usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does

This paper serves to evaluate Quickpath Interconnect, HyperTransport and PCI
Express as highspeed interconnect technologies. A comparison will be made,
highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each technology. Quickpath
Interconnect is a proprietary technology developed by Intel to increase the
available bandwidth between the CPU and the north bridge. PCI Express is
technology managed by PCISIG that serves as a replacement for PCI and PCI-X,
while also attempting to be a consumer grade highspeed motherboard--level
interconnect. HyperTransport is an interconnect technology designed by AMD
designed to functionas a direct to CPU interconnect for I/O devices. This paper
will summarize each technology in detail, comparing the advantages and
disadvantages of each technology as well as a brief synopsis about how each
interconnect functions.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
% no \IEEEPARstart
As computers are increasing in performance in the areas of memory, networking,
storage and processing, the interconnects must also improve. The improvement of
interconnects comes as a necessity so that overall systems performance does not
become hindered as other components improve. Such components include the
processor, memory and I/O devices which are constantly increasing in bandwidth,
the interconnects that connect these devices must also improve. 
In modern computers, the northbridge typically serves as the interconnect fabric
between the southbridge, graphics and memory hub to the processor. The
southbridge is responsible for communicating with slower I/O devices and the
north bridge. However, in high performance computing, it can be easy to find
that the bandwidth required to perform certain tasks can exceed that of the
available bandwidth. This is where it is often necessary to look at faster
interconnect technologies such as HyperTransport, QPI or PCI Express. 
Each technology addresses the need for faster I/O with the CPU in a different
way. The way in which this is done can vary greatly with each technology and
with differing results. This paper will address the differences between each
technology and examine the advantages versus the disadvantages of each
technology to provide an unbiased analysis.

\section{HyperTransport}
\label{sec:ht}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{subsec:ht:over}
HyperTransport was originally designed to support to need simplify high-speed
data traffic between memory, I/O or the processor. The first
specification, HyperTransport 1.03 defined a bandwidth of up
to 12.8 GB/s aggregate bandwidth.\cite{htWhitePaper} HyperTransport 2.0
supports 22.4 GB/s aggregate bandwidth and the newest specification,
HyperTransport 3.10 supports up to 25.6GB/s unidirectional.

HyperTransport is refered to as a ``mezzanine connector from a system's main
processor or memory controller to another I/O, often a PCI bus, within the
system, perhaps for additional chip or component.''\cite{paulson2003ins} As I
have read, HyperTransport is often directly connected to the CPU and functions
similarly to the northbridge but only for highspeed I/O devices. 

HyperTransport is a point-to-point link technology that uses two seperate
point-to-point links for bi-directional traffic, up to speeds of 51.2GB/s
bidirectional. A set of HyperTransport links can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:htLinks}. 

HyperTransport is also a very low latency protocol with a very high bandwith
capability. It is achieved by the following:\cite{duato2009extending}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimizing packet overhead
  \item Eliminating control and command signals needed by other protocols
  \item Reducing crosstalk and interference
\end{itemize}

HyperTransport is however primarily a host-to-host or host-to-I/O protocol. It
does not see that same benefits as it is expanded to larger scale
environments. HyperTransport interconnects can function as a replacement of the
northbridge,  a multiprocessor interconnect or a switch bus. 
HyperTransport has four different protocol versions. HT protocol 1.x and 2.0
are clock-forwarded interface types. The links are considered to be
uni-directional reliable links, operating at a clock speed of 200 Mhz to 3.2Mhz(HT3.1).
HyperTransport 3.0 and up is not considered to be reliable due to the use of
data recovery techniques.\cite{holden2006latency}. However, it can be shown that
the rate of bit errors is low. 
HyperTransport was designed to be an extremely low latency protocol. With this
in mind, the designers created HyperTransport in such a way as to minimize the
latency within the physical, data link and transaction layer. This is due to
the low amount of packet overhead generated by the headers in a HT packet and a
skew-constrained PCB.

	\begin{caption}{
	 The HyperTransport Link consists of at least one host (often a
	 HyperTransport-enabled CPU) and one tunnel/endpoint. A tunnel enables the
	 HyperTransport link to be passed from one HyperTransport-enabled device to
	 another in daisy-chain fashion.
	\cite{htWhitePaper}\label{fig:htLinks}}
	\end{caption}
	
\end{figure}

\subsection{How does it operate?}
\label{subsec:ht:oper}
HyperTransport is often connected directly to the CPU. It serves as a bridge
between highspeed I/O devices and the CPU providing a high bandwidth channel for
multiple devices to use to communicate. Each devices is connected to the HT bus
through a daisy chain. Up to 32 devices to be connected to any single daisy
chain. The daisy chain operates by allowing a device to take up a set of lines,
of which do not have to match the number of lines taken by other devices. For
example, a single I/O devices connected to the HT unit, can utilize 2 lines,
while another device can use 8. 
The HT protocol maintains the high speed by eliminating overhead from packets
transfered. The read packets of a HT link only have an overhead of 8 bytes while
the write packets have an overhead of 12 bytes. This minimal amount of bytes
reserved for overhead results in a large boost in performance.
