The project is compiled through the use of the provided makefile. The make
files use nasm and gcc for each compilation step. 

To build, test AND clean:
----------------------------------
make 


To create the solution executables:
-----------------------------------
make build	#creates all executables


The make file will call make in each child directory and build the solutions. 

Each solution executable will be named 'p1q#' where # is the number of the
question. 

Each solution also broken down into the .c and .asm code for each question. 


To run each solution:
-----------------------------------
make test 

-- OR --

cd Q1 && ./p1q1 && cd .. \
cd Q2 && ./p1q2 && cd .. \
cd Q3 && ./p1q3 && cd .. 


To perform cleanup:
-----------------------------------
make clean


Note: 
'make' without any arguments will perform all three steps at once.
